    <h1>Project 1 - Solar Energy and CO2 Emissions</h1>
    <hr>

    <h3>This project looked at US energy consumption and CO2 emissions and the inpact
        of using solar enegery on CO2 emissions.
     </h3>

    <h2>Total Energy Consumption</h2>

    <br>
    <p>Total energy consumption did not change very much from 2000 - 2015, although there was
        a dip in conusmption in 2009.  The industrial sector makes up approximately half of 
        the total energy consumption.

    <h2>Total CO2 Emissions</h2>

    <br>
    <p>Total CO2 emissions decreased from 2000 to 2015, with a dip in 2009 which corresponds to the dip in energy consumption.  The industrial sector makes up 65% the total CO2 emissions.

    <h2>Total Solar Energy Consumption</h2>

    <img src="final_images/Fig16.png"  alt="pie chart of solar energy consumption">
    <br>
    <p>Total solar energy consumption sharply increased starting in 2009.  Opposed to total energy consumption and CO2 emissions, the residential sector makes up nearly 80% the total solar energy consumption.

    <h2>Regression Analysis</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="final_images/totenergy_co2_regress.png"  alt="regression of energy and CO2 emissions">
    <br>
    <p>Regression analysis indicates that total energy consumption account for approximately 50% of the variabiity seen in CO2 emissions.  The increased utilization of solar energy and other 'green' energy sources may account for the lack of fit for this regression model.
